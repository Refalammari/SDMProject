By leveraging this dataset, we intend to predict the likelihood of a patient experiencing a stroke based on parameters such as gender, age, existing medical conditions, and smoking status. Each entry in the dataset furnishes pertinent details about the patient, facilitating comprehensive analysis and predictive modeling.\nclassification goal involve using data mining to build a predictive model that classifies individuals into two categories: those at high risk of experiencing a stroke and those at low risk.\n\n\n\n# 2- Dataset:\n\nOur dataset source is Kaggle : <https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fedesoriano/stroke-prediction-dataset>\n\n\n# 3- Genral info about the dataset:\n\nAmong the 5110 objects in our dataset sample, 12 attributes are used to describe them. (See Table 1).\n the class label for our dataset is Stroke hat took two values 1 and 0 to indicate whether they are sufferd from it or not.\n\n ##### Table 1: General Information about the attributes \n\n\n",
