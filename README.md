# Stroke Prediction - IT326
Group #2 data mining project 

Stroke ranks as the second leading cause of death globally and is the primary cause of disability. With the World Health Organization estimating that 1 in 4 individuals may encounter a stroke during their lifetime, we've opted to focus on this dataset due to the indiscriminate nature of strokes, affecting individuals of all ages. Our aim is to delve into the data, investigating and analyzing it to identify potential risk factors and gain insights into the demographics most susceptible to strokes. By leveraging this dataset, we intend to predict the likelihood of a patient experiencing a stroke based on parameters such as gender, age, existing medical conditions, and smoking status. Each entry in the dataset furnishes pertinent details about the patient, facilitating comprehensive analysis and predictive modeling.
