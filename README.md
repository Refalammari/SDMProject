# Stroke Prediction - IT326
Group #2 data mining project 

Stroke ranks as the second leading cause of death globally and is the primary cause of disability. With the World Health Organization estimating that 1 in 4 individuals may encounter a stroke during their lifetime, we've opted to focus on this dataset due to the indiscriminate nature of strokes, affecting individuals of all ages.
