# 1- Goal:

Stroke ranks as the second leading cause of death globally and is the primary cause of disability. With the World Health Organization estimating that 1 in 4 individuals may encounter a stroke during their lifetime, we've opted to focus on this dataset due to the indiscriminate nature of strokes, affecting individuals of all ages. Our aim is to delve into the data, investigating and analyzing it to identify potential risk factors and gain insights into the demographics most susceptible to strokes. By leveraging this dataset, we intend to predict the likelihood of a patient experiencing a stroke based on parameters such as gender, age, existing medical conditions, and smoking status. Each entry in the dataset furnishes pertinent details about the patient, facilitating comprehensive analysis and predictive modeling.


# 2- Dataset:

Our dataset source is Kaggle : <https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fedesoriano/stroke-prediction-dataset>


# 3- Genral info about the dataset:

Among the 5110 objects in our dataset sample, 12 attributes are used to describe them. (See Table 1).
 the class label for our dataset is Stroke hat took two values 1 and 0 to indicate whether they are sufferd from it or not.
